### Software Engineer
### AI enthusiast, fluent in Python, UIPATH and Web Development

I am a third-year student at the University of Southampton studying Electronic Engineering. I have a strong interest in AI advancements and machine learning applications (such as financial markets and medicine). Outside my degree course, I have also attended occasional courses on accounting and finance to expand my personal knowledge and took part in volunteering experiences.
